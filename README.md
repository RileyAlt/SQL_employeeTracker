### Description

My Motivation for the project was to understand Node items further and introducing Command-line applications, While going into a new database MySQL

The project was built to create a responsive command-line  that can manage a companines database. You are able to update remove or add employees with ease all within your terminal

This solved how to us MySQL and how the databese paths work, it also gives me a greater untstanding as to the power your command line has on your computer. 

What I learn from the project was how to use Node properties to create different Inquireries to Manage a company database
